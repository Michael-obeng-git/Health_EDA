# Week 7 Lab: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Heart Health Dataset

## Objective

By the end of this lab session, students will:

Understand the steps involved in EDA, including loading and inspecting data, cleaning, and analyzing relationships.
Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
Identify and visualize patterns, anomalies, and correlations in the dataset.

### Dataset

Filename: heart_data.csv
Description: Contains information on heart health indicators, including demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables.

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Data Loading and Inspection
- Import necessary libraries.
- Load the dataset.
- Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

### Task 2: Data Cleaning
- Handle Misrepresented Data in Columns:
- Check each column to ensure it contains the correct data.
- Encode categorical columns if necessary.

#### Handle Missing Values:

- Count missing values in each column.
- Decide on strategies for handling missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).

#### Handle Duplicates:

- Check for and address any duplicate entries.

### Task 3: Univariate Analysis

- Visualize Distributions of Numerical Variables:
- Use histograms and boxplots to understand distributions.

#### Analyze Categorical Variables:
- Plot bar charts to visualize frequency distributions.

#### Task 4: Bivariate Analysis

- Numerical-Numerical Relationships:
- Create scatterplots to explore relationships.
- Calculate the correlation matrix.
- Categorical-Numerical Relationships:
- Use boxplots to compare the target variable across independent variables.

Categorical-Categorical Relationships:
- Create crosstabs to explore relationships between categories.

### Task 5: Multivariate Analysis
- Use pairplots to visualize multiple relationships simultaneously.

### Task 6: Communication of Insights

### Summarize Findings:

- Identify the most significant predictors of heart disease.
- Highlight notable patterns (e.g., higher risk in specific age groups or genders).
- Create Visualizations to Support Conclusions
